# Fun with algorithmic composition

This is a place for me to play around with some different methods of 
algorithmic composition in Python. It's currently just the barest possible proof
of concept with a Markov chain composer, but I'll be adding to it and majorly 
changing the structure of the code to make it more extensible. 

## Current requirements
